## Introduction

### Manifestation / Visualisation
Describe the way the natural or supernatural law manifests itself. For example, the colour that fire takes when a specific element burns, or the effect of magnetism and gravity to the auroras of your skies etc.

### Localization
In some cases, especially when it comes to metaphysical/magical laws, the effects or the laws themselves might be localized. Describe here which locations and why this law applies. An example could be a "dead magic area" or a leyline of magic energy etc.
