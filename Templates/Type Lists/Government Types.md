# Forms Of Government
## By Regional Control
### Confederation
&emsp;A confederation (also known as a confederacy or league) is a union of sovereign states, united for purposes of common action often in relation to other states. Usually created by a [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty"), confederations of states are usually established for dealing with critical issues, such as defense, foreign relations, internal trade or currency, with the [general government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government "Central government") being required to provide support for all its members. Confederation represents a main form of inter-governmental-ism, this being defined as "any form of interaction between states which takes place on the basis of sovereign independence or government." Confederation is almost as a federation with the federal government being as a combination or alliance of all the states.
### Unitary State
&emsp;A unitary state is a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") governed as a single power in which the [central government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government "Central government") is ultimately supreme and any [administrative divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division "Administrative division") (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 [UN member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations"), 165 are governed as unitary states.
### Federation
&emsp;A federation (also known as a federal state) is a [political entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_entity "Political entity") characterized by a [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_union "Political union") of partially [self-governing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_state "Federated state") or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.
## By Source Of Power
### Autocracy
&emsp;Autocracy is a [system of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") in which supreme [power (social and political)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") is concentrated in the hands of one person or [polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity"), whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "Coup d'état") or mass [insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection "Insurrection")). [Absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") (such as [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), the [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates "United Arab Emirates"), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "Oman"), [Brunei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei "Brunei") and [Eswatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini "Eswatini")) and [dictatorships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorships "Dictatorships") are the main modern-day forms of autocracy. In family dictatorships, political power is passed down within one family because of the overwhelming authority of the leader. For example, in [Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvalier_dynasty "Duvalier dynasty") a form of hereditary dictatorship was founded by [François Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier "François Duvalier") (_Papa Doc_); it operated much like an absolute monarchy, yet within a nominally republican state. In 1971, [Jean-Claude Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Duvalier "Jean-Claude Duvalier") (_Baby Doc_) became Haiti's next [dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_for_life "President for life") after his father's death. Both totalitarian and military dictatorships are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy.
#### Civilian Dictatorship
A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity"). That person may be, for example, an [absolute monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") or a [dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship "Dictatorship"), but can also be an elected [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)"). The [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that is not stopped by any rules of law, [constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"), or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") and the [Kim dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_family_(North_Korea) "Kim family (North Korea)") of [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") founded by [Kim Il Sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung "Kim Il Sung").
#### Military Dictatorship
A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [civilian dictators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_dictatorship "Civilian dictatorship") for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as "neutral" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as "National Redemption Council", "Committee of National Restoration", or "National Liberation Committee". Military leaders often rule as a [junta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta "Military junta"), selecting one of them as the head.
### Oligarchy
&emsp;Oligarchy, meaning "rule of the few", is a form of [power structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_structure "Power structure") in which [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility"), [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth "Wealth"), [family ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_ties "Family ties"), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education") or [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate "Corporate"), [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious "Religious") or [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation "Generation") to the next, but [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance "Inheritance") is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.
#### Aristocracy
&emsp;Rule by the nobility; a system of governance where political power is in the hands of a small class of privileged individuals who claim a higher birth than the rest of society.
#### Ergatocracy
&emsp;Rule by the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat"), the workers, or the working class. Examples of ergatocracy include communist revolutionaries and rebels which control most of society and create an alternative economy for people and workers. See [Dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat "Dictatorship of the proletariat").
#### Geniocracy
&emsp;A term invented by the founder of [Raëlism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism "Raëlism") meaning rule by the intelligent; a system of governance where creativity, innovation, intelligence, and wisdom are required for those who wish to govern. Comparable to [noocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy "Noocracy").
#### Hamarchy
&emsp;The joint rule of different regions retaining their individuality; a system of government consisting of many distinct or independent parts that rule together.
#### Kraterocracy
&emsp;Rule by the strong; a system of governance where those who are strong enough to seize power through physical force, social manoeuvring or political cunning.
#### Kritarchy
&emsp;Rule by various judges, the _kritarchs_; a system of governance composed of law enforcement institutions in which the state and the [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system "Legal system") are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. The kritarchs, magistrates and other adjudicators have the legal power to legislate and administer the enforcement of government laws in addition to the interposition of laws and the resolution of disputes. (Not to be confused with _"[judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary "Judiciary")"_ or _"[judicial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_system "Judicial system")"_.) [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), ruled by judges with the tradition of [xeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeer "Xeer"), as well as the [Islamic Courts Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Courts_Union "Islamic Courts Union"), is a historical example.
#### Meritocracy
&emsp;Rule by the meritorious; a system of governance where groups are selected on the basis of people's ability, knowledge in a given area, and contributions to society.
#### Netocracy
&emsp;Rule by social connections; a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine _Wired_ in the early 1990s. A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [Richard Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Florida "Richard Florida")'s concept of the [creative class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class "Creative class"). Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [netocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netocracy "Netocracy"), which they refer to as the consumitariat.
#### Noocracy
&emsp;Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"))
#### Plutocracy
&emsp;Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.
#### Particracy
Rule by a dominant [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party") (or parties).
#### Stratocracy
Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with "[military junta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta "Military junta")" or "[military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship "Military dictatorship")".) The [Spartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta "Sparta") [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state") is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [timocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timocracy "Timocracy").
#### Technocracy
Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists. In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field. Technocracy is today represented by global algorithmic governance by Silicon Valley engineers. This recent form of technocracy has been called 'digitocracy'.
#### Theocracy
Rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. [The Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See")'s (see [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope")), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran")'s and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan")'s (see [Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran "Supreme Leader of Iran")), [Caliphates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate") and other [Islamic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state "Islamic state") are historically considered _theocracies_.
#### Timocracy
Rule by the [honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour "Honour"); a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy "Meritocracy"), in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.
### Democracy
&emsp;Democracy, meaning "rule of the people", is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament "Parliament"). Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority". Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. This does include citizens being able to vote for different laws and leaders.
#### Demarchy
&emsp;Government in which the state is governed by [randomly selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_selection "Random selection") decision from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. These groups, sometimes termed "policy juries", "citizens' juries", or "consensus conferences", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [juries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury "Jury") decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"), which is widely subject to manipulation by [special interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_interests "Special interests") and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [John Burnheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burnheim "John Burnheim"), random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.

&emsp;More generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition "Sortition") (from the Latin base for lottery). The [Athenian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy") made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.
#### Direct Democracy
&emsp;Government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.
#### Electocracy
&emsp;A form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision-making. The government has almost absolute power.
#### Herrenvoik Democracy
&emsp;A [form of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_government "Form of government") in which only a specific ethnic group participates in government, while other ethnic groups are disenfranchised. Though elections may be free, voting suffrage is restricted based on race, with governance reflecting the interests of the politically dominant racial group.
#### Liberal Democracy
&emsp;A form of government in which [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") operates under the principles of [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism"). It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election "Election") between [multiple distinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy) "Pluralism (political philosophy)") [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party"), a [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") into different [branches of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_government "Branches of government"), the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Rule of law") in everyday life as part of an [open society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society "Open society"), and the protection of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") and [civil liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties") for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"), either formally written or [uncodified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncodified_constitution "Uncodified constitution"), to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract "Social contract"). After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic "Republic"), such as [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"); or a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy"), such as the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") or [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"). It may have a [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system") ([Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), or the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")), a [semi-presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system "Semi-presidential system") ([France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), or [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal")), a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system") ([Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), or [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")) or [directorial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorial_system "Directorial system").
#### Liquid Democracy
&emsp;Government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.
#### Representative Democracy
&emsp;Wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.
#### Social Democracy
&emsp;Elements of direct and representative democracies are combined in a form of [participatory democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy "Participatory democracy"). It also adopts a [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") combining the principles of a [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") [free-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market "Free-market") and [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism "Economic interventionism") or [social interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interventionism "Social interventionism").

&emsp;Social democracy rejects the "either/or" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.
#### Soviet Democracy
&emsp;The citizens are governed by directly elected councils. The councils are directly responsible to their electors and are bound by their instructions. Such an imperative mandate is in contrast to a free mandate, in which the elected delegates are only responsible to their conscience. Delegates may accordingly be dismissed from their post at any time or be voted out (recall).
#### Totalitarian Democracy
&emsp;A form of electocracy in which lawfully elected representatives maintain the integrity of a nation state whose citizens, while granted the right to vote, have little or no participation in the decision-making process of the government.
#### Electoral Autocracy
&emsp;A [hybrid regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_regime "Hybrid regime"), in which democratic institutions are imitative and adhere to authoritarian methods. In these regimes, regular elections are held, but they fail to reach democratic standards of freedom and fairness.
### Anarchy
&emsp;A place where there are no laws. Sometimes said to be non-governance; it is a structure which strives for non-hierarchical, voluntary associations among agents.

&emsp;This can be a natural, temporary result of civil war in a country, when an established state has been destroyed and the region is in a transitional period without definitive leadership. Alternatively, it has been presented as a viable long-term choice by individuals known as [anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists") who oppose the state and other forms of coercive hierarchies. These individuals typically think people should organize in non-hierarchical, [voluntary associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association "Voluntary association") where people [voluntarily help each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory) "Mutual aid (organization theory)"). There are a variety of forms of anarchy that attempt to discourage the use of coercion, violence, force and authority, while still producing a productive and desirable society.
### Pejorative attributes
&emsp;Regardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [political power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") which are not part of the formal government. These are terms that highlight certain actions of the governors, such as [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption "Corruption"), [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagoguery "Demagoguery"), or [fear mongering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_mongering "Fear mongering") that may disrupt the intended way of working of the government if they are widespread enough.
#### Banana Republic
&emsp;A politically unstable and kleptocratic government that economically depends upon the exports of a limited resource (fruits, minerals), and usually features a society composed of [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification "Social stratification") [social classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(social) "Class (social)"), such as a great, impoverished ergatocracy and a ruling plutocracy, composed of the aristocracy of business, politics, and the military. In [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"), the term _banana republic_ denotes a country dependent upon limited [primary-sector productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy "Primary sector of the economy"), which is ruled by a [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "Plutocracy") who exploit the national economy by means of a politico-economic [oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy"). In [American literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_literature "American literature"), the term _banana republic_ originally denoted the fictional _Republic of Anchuria_, a servile dictatorship that abetted, or supported for [kickbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery) "Kickback (bribery)"), the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation. In U.S. politics, the term [banana republic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banana_republic "wikt:banana republic") is a pejorative political descriptor coined by the American writer [O. Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry "O. Henry") in _Cabbages and Kings_ (1904), a book of thematically related short stories derived from his 1896–1897 residence in [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), where he was hiding from U.S. law for bank [embezzlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement "Embezzlement").
#### Bankocracy
Rule by banks; a system of governance with excessive power or influence of banks and other financial authorities on public policy-making. It can also refer to a form of government where financial institutions rule society.
#### Corporatocracy
Rule by corporations; a system of governance where an economic and political system is controlled by corporations or corporate interests. Its use is generally pejorative. Examples include [company rule in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_India "Company rule in India"), and the business voters for the [City of London Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Corporation "City of London Corporation").
#### Kakistocracy
Rule by the worst; a system of government where the least-qualified citizens govern or dictate policies.
#### Kleptocracy
Rule by thieves; a system of governance where its officials and the ruling class in general pursue personal wealth and political power at the expense of the wider population. In strict terms kleptocracy is not a form of government but a characteristic of a government engaged in such behavior.
#### Nepotocracy
Rule by nephews; [favouritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism "In-group favoritism") granted to [relatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship "Kinship") regardless of [merit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merit "wikt:merit"); a system of governance in which importance is given to the relatives of those already in power, like a _nephew_ (where the word comes from). In such governments even if the relatives aren't qualified they are given positions of authority just because they know someone who already has authority. [Pope Alexander VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI "Pope Alexander VI") ([Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgia "Borgia")) was accused of this.
#### Ochlocracy
Rule by the crowd; a system of governance where mob rule is government by mob or a mass of people, or the [intimidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation "Intimidation") of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for [majoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarianism "Majoritarianism"), it is akin to the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") phrase _mobile vulgus_ meaning "the fickle crowd", from which the English term "mob" was originally derived in the 1680s. Ochlocratic governments are often a democracy spoiled by [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagoguery "Demagoguery"), "[tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority "Tyranny of the majority")" and the rule of passion over reason; such governments can be as oppressive as autocratic tyrants. Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term "mobocracy".
### Other Attributes
#### Adhocracy
Rule by a government based on relatively disorganized principles and institutions as compared to a [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy"), its exact opposite.
#### Anocracy
