# Forms Of Government
## By Regional Control
### Confederation
&emsp;A confederation (also known as a confederacy or league) is a union of sovereign states, united for purposes of common action often in relation to other states. Usually created by a [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty "Treaty"), confederations of states are usually established for dealing with critical issues, such as defense, foreign relations, internal trade or currency, with the [general government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government "Central government") being required to provide support for all its members. Confederation represents a main form of inter-governmental-ism, this being defined as "any form of interaction between states which takes place on the basis of sovereign independence or government." Confederation is almost as a federation with the federal government being as a combination or alliance of all the states.
### Unitary State
&emsp;A unitary state is a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") governed as a single power in which the [central government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government "Central government") is ultimately supreme and any [administrative divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division "Administrative division") (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 [UN member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations"), 165 are governed as unitary states.
### Federation
&emsp;A federation (also known as a federal state) is a [political entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_entity "Political entity") characterized by a [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_union "Political union") of partially [self-governing states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_state "Federated state") or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.
## By Source Of Power
### Autocracy
&emsp;Autocracy is a [system of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") in which supreme [power (social and political)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") is concentrated in the hands of one person or [polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity"), whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "Coup d'état") or mass [insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection "Insurrection")). [Absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") (such as [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), the [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates "United Arab Emirates"), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "Oman"), [Brunei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei "Brunei") and [Eswatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini "Eswatini")) and [dictatorships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorships "Dictatorships") are the main modern-day forms of autocracy. In family dictatorships, political power is passed down within one family because of the overwhelming authority of the leader. For example, in [Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvalier_dynasty "Duvalier dynasty") a form of hereditary dictatorship was founded by [François Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Duvalier "François Duvalier") (_Papa Doc_); it operated much like an absolute monarchy, yet within a nominally republican state. In 1971, [Jean-Claude Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Duvalier "Jean-Claude Duvalier") (_Baby Doc_) became Haiti's next [dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_for_life "President for life") after his father's death. Both totalitarian and military dictatorships are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy.
#### Civilian Dictatorship
A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [polity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity "Polity"). That person may be, for example, an [absolute monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy") or a [dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship "Dictatorship"), but can also be an elected [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)"). The [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that is not stopped by any rules of law, [constitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"), or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"), [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") and the [Kim dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_family_(North_Korea) "Kim family (North Korea)") of [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") founded by [Kim Il Sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung "Kim Il Sung").
#### Military Dictatorship
A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [civilian dictators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_dictatorship "Civilian dictatorship") for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as "neutral" arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as "National Redemption Council", "Committee of National Restoration", or "National Liberation Committee". Military leaders often rule as a [junta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta "Military junta"), selecting one of them as the head.
### Oligarchy
&emsp;Oligarchy, meaning "rule of the few", is a form of [power structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_structure "Power structure") in which [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility"), [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth "Wealth"), [family ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_ties "Family ties"), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education") or [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate "Corporate"), [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious "Religious") or [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military") control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation "Generation") to the next, but [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance "Inheritance") is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.
#### Aristocracy
&emsp;Rule by the nobility; a system of governance where political power is in the hands of a small class of privileged individuals who claim a higher birth than the rest of society.
#### Ergatocracy
&emsp;Rule by the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat"), the workers, or the working class. Examples of ergatocracy include communist revolutionaries and rebels which control most of society and create an alternative economy for people and workers. See [Dictatorship of the proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat "Dictatorship of the proletariat").
#### Geniocracy
&emsp;A term invented by the founder of [Raëlism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlism "Raëlism") meaning rule by the intelligent; a system of governance where creativity, innovation, intelligence, and wisdom are required for those who wish to govern. Comparable to [noocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy "Noocracy").
#### Hamarchy
&emsp;The joint rule of different regions retaining their individuality; a system of government consisting of many distinct or independent parts that rule together.
#### Kraterocracy
&emsp;Rule by the strong; a system of governance where those who are strong enough to seize power through physical force, social manoeuvring or political cunning.
#### Kritarchy
&emsp;Rule by various judges, the _kritarchs_; a system of governance composed of law enforcement institutions in which the state and the [legal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system "Legal system") are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. The kritarchs, magistrates and other adjudicators have the legal power to legislate and administer the enforcement of government laws in addition to the interposition of laws and the resolution of disputes. (Not to be confused with _"[judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary "Judiciary")"_ or _"[judicial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_system "Judicial system")"_.) [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia"), ruled by judges with the tradition of [xeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeer "Xeer"), as well as the [Islamic Courts Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Courts_Union "Islamic Courts Union"), is a historical example.
#### Meritocracy
&emsp;Rule by the meritorious; a system of governance where groups are selected on the basis of people's ability, knowledge in a given area, and contributions to society.
#### Netocracy
&emsp;Rule by social connections; a term invented by the editorial board of the American technology magazine _Wired_ in the early 1990s. A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [Richard Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Florida "Richard Florida")'s concept of the [creative class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class "Creative class"). Bard and Söderqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [netocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netocracy "Netocracy"), which they refer to as the consumitariat.
#### Noocracy
&emsp;Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato"))
#### Plutocracy
&emsp;Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.
#### Particracy
Rule by a dominant [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party") (or parties).
#### Stratocracy
Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with "[military junta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta "Military junta")" or "[military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship "Military dictatorship")".) The [Spartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta "Sparta") [city-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state "City-state") is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [timocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timocracy "Timocracy").
#### Technocracy
Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists. In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field. Technocracy is today represented by global algorithmic governance by Silicon Valley engineers. This recent form of technocracy has been called 'digitocracy'.
#### Theocracy
Rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [constitutionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") the same entity. [The Vatican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See "Holy See")'s (see [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope")), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran")'s and [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan")'s (see [Supreme Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran "Supreme Leader of Iran")), [Caliphates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate "Caliphate") and other [Islamic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state "Islamic state") are historically considered _theocracies_.
#### Timocracy
Rule by the [honourable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour "Honour"); a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy "Meritocracy"), in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.
### Democracy
&emsp;Democracy, meaning "rule of the people", is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament "Parliament"). Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority". Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes. This does include citizens being able to vote for different laws and leaders.
#### Demarchy
&emsp;Government in which the state is governed by [randomly selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_selection "Random selection") decision from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. These groups, sometimes termed "policy juries", "citizens' juries", or "consensus conferences", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [juries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury "Jury") decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"), which is widely subject to manipulation by [special interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_interests "Special interests") and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [John Burnheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burnheim "John Burnheim"), random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.

&emsp;More generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition "Sortition") (from the Latin base for lottery). The [Athenian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy") made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.
#### Direct Democracy
&emsp;Government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.
#### Electocracy
&emsp;A form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision-making. The government has almost absolute power.
#### Herrenvoik Democracy
&emsp;A [form of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_government "Form of government") in which only a specific ethnic group participates in government, while other ethnic groups are disenfranchised. Though elections may be free, voting suffrage is restricted based on race, with governance reflecting the interests of the politically dominant racial group.
#### Liberal Democracy
&emsp;A form of government in which [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") operates under the principles of [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism"). It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election "Election") between [multiple distinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy) "Pluralism (political philosophy)") [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party"), a [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") into different [branches of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_government "Branches of government"), the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Rule of law") in everyday life as part of an [open society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society "Open society"), and the protection of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") and [civil liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties") for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"), either formally written or [uncodified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncodified_constitution "Uncodified constitution"), to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract "Social contract"). After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic "Republic"), such as [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"); or a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy"), such as the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") or [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain "Spain"). It may have a [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system") ([Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), or the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")), a [semi-presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system "Semi-presidential system") ([France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), or [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal")), a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system") ([Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland "Republic of Ireland"), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), or [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")) or [directorial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorial_system "Directorial system").
#### Liquid Democracy
&emsp;Government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.
#### Representative Democracy
&emsp;Wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.
#### Social Democracy
&emsp;Elements of direct and representative democracies are combined in a form of [participatory democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy "Participatory democracy"). It also adopts a [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") combining the principles of a [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") [free-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market "Free-market") and [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism "Economic interventionism") or [social interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interventionism "Social interventionism").

&emsp;Social democracy rejects the "either/or" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.
#### Soviet Democracy
&emsp;The citizens are governed by directly elected councils. The councils are directly responsible to their electors and are bound by their instructions. Such an imperative mandate is in contrast to a free mandate, in which the elected delegates are only responsible to their conscience. Delegates may accordingly be dismissed from their post at any time or be voted out (recall).
#### Totalitarian Democracy
&emsp;A form of electocracy in which lawfully elected representatives maintain the integrity of a nation state whose citizens, while granted the right to vote, have little or no participation in the decision-making process of the government.
#### Electoral Autocracy
&emsp;A [hybrid regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_regime "Hybrid regime"), in which democratic institutions are imitative and adhere to authoritarian methods. In these regimes, regular elections are held, but they fail to reach democratic standards of freedom and fairness.
### Anarchy
&emsp;A place where there are no laws. Sometimes said to be non-governance; it is a structure which strives for non-hierarchical, voluntary associations among agents.

&emsp;This can be a natural, temporary result of civil war in a country, when an established state has been destroyed and the region is in a transitional period without definitive leadership. Alternatively, it has been presented as a viable long-term choice by individuals known as [anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists") who oppose the state and other forms of coercive hierarchies. These individuals typically think people should organize in non-hierarchical, [voluntary associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association "Voluntary association") where people [voluntarily help each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory) "Mutual aid (organization theory)"). There are a variety of forms of anarchy that attempt to discourage the use of coercion, violence, force and authority, while still producing a productive and desirable society.
### Pejorative attributes
&emsp;Regardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [political power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political) "Power (social and political)") which are not part of the formal government. These are terms that highlight certain actions of the governors, such as [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption "Corruption"), [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagoguery "Demagoguery"), or [fear mongering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_mongering "Fear mongering") that may disrupt the intended way of working of the government if they are widespread enough.
#### Banana Republic
&emsp;A politically unstable and kleptocratic government that economically depends upon the exports of a limited resource (fruits, minerals), and usually features a society composed of [stratified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification "Social stratification") [social classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(social) "Class (social)"), such as a great, impoverished ergatocracy and a ruling plutocracy, composed of the aristocracy of business, politics, and the military. In [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"), the term _banana republic_ denotes a country dependent upon limited [primary-sector productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy "Primary sector of the economy"), which is ruled by a [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "Plutocracy") who exploit the national economy by means of a politico-economic [oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy"). In [American literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_literature "American literature"), the term _banana republic_ originally denoted the fictional _Republic of Anchuria_, a servile dictatorship that abetted, or supported for [kickbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery) "Kickback (bribery)"), the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation. In U.S. politics, the term [banana republic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banana_republic "wikt:banana republic") is a pejorative political descriptor coined by the American writer [O. Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry "O. Henry") in _Cabbages and Kings_ (1904), a book of thematically related short stories derived from his 1896–1897 residence in [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), where he was hiding from U.S. law for bank [embezzlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement "Embezzlement").
#### Bankocracy
&emsp;Rule by banks; a system of governance with excessive power or influence of banks and other financial authorities on public policy-making. It can also refer to a form of government where financial institutions rule society.
#### Corporatocracy
&emsp;Rule by corporations; a system of governance where an economic and political system is controlled by corporations or corporate interests. Its use is generally pejorative. Examples include [company rule in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_India "Company rule in India"), and the business voters for the [City of London Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London_Corporation "City of London Corporation").
#### Kakistocracy
&emsp;Rule by the worst; a system of government where the least-qualified citizens govern or dictate policies.
#### Kleptocracy
&emsp;Rule by thieves; a system of governance where its officials and the ruling class in general pursue personal wealth and political power at the expense of the wider population. In strict terms kleptocracy is not a form of government but a characteristic of a government engaged in such behavior.
#### Nepotocracy
&emsp;Rule by nephews; [favouritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism "In-group favoritism") granted to [relatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship "Kinship") regardless of [merit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merit "wikt:merit"); a system of governance in which importance is given to the relatives of those already in power, like a _nephew_ (where the word comes from). In such governments even if the relatives aren't qualified they are given positions of authority just because they know someone who already has authority. [Pope Alexander VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI "Pope Alexander VI") ([Borgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgia "Borgia")) was accused of this.
#### Ochlocracy
&emsp;Rule by the crowd; a system of governance where mob rule is government by mob or a mass of people, or the [intimidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation "Intimidation") of legitimate authorities. As a pejorative for [majoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarianism "Majoritarianism"), it is akin to the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") phrase _mobile vulgus_ meaning "the fickle crowd", from which the English term "mob" was originally derived in the 1680s. Ochlocratic governments are often a democracy spoiled by [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagoguery "Demagoguery"), "[tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority "Tyranny of the majority")" and the rule of passion over reason; such governments can be as oppressive as autocratic tyrants. Ochlocracy is synonymous in meaning and usage to the modern, informal term "mobocracy".
### Other Attributes
#### Adhocracy
&emsp;Rule by a government based on relatively disorganized principles and institutions as compared to a [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy "Bureaucracy"), its exact opposite.
#### Anocracy
&emsp;A regime type where power is not vested in public institutions (as in a normal democracy) but spread amongst elite groups who are constantly competing with each other for power. Examples of anocracies in Africa include the warlords of [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia "Somalia") and the shared governments in [samaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaya "Samaya") and [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe "Zimbabwe"). Anocracies are situated midway between an [autocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy "Autocracy") and a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy").

&emsp;The [Polity IV dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity_data_series "Polity data series") recognizes anocracy as a category. In that dataset, anocracies are exactly in the middle between autocracies and democracies.

&emsp;Often the word is defined more broadly. For example, a 2010 [International Alert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alert "International Alert") publication defined anocracies as "countries that are neither autocratic nor democratic, most of which are making the risky transition between autocracy and democracy". Alert noted that the number of anocracies had increased substantially since the end of the Cold War. Anocracy is not surprisingly the least resilient political system to short-term shocks: it creates the promise but not yet the actuality of an inclusive and effective political economy, and threatens members of the established elite; and is therefore very vulnerable to disruption and armed violence.
#### Band Society
&emsp;Rule by a government based on small (usually family) unit with a semi-informal hierarchy, with strongest (either physical strength or strength of character) as leader.
#### Bureaucracy
&emsp;Rule by a system of governance with many bureaus, administrators, and petty officials.
#### Constitutionalism
&emsp;Rule by a government based on consensus democracy.
#### Military Junta
&emsp;Rule by a committee of military leaders.
#### Nomocracy
&emsp;Rule by a government under the sovereignty of rational laws and civic right as opposed to one under theocratic systems of government. In a nomocracy, ultimate and final authority (sovereignty) exists in the law.
#### Cyberocracy
&emsp;Rule by a computer, which decides based on computer code and efficient use of information. This is closely linked to Cybersynacy and could be the 'solution' to communism. This type of ruling appears in the short story "[The Machine Stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Stops "The Machine Stops")" by E. M. Forster.
#### Algocracy
&emsp;Rule by algorithms used in diverse levels of bureaucracy, which is also known as algorithmic regulation, regulation by algorithms, algorithmic governance, algorithmic legal order of government by algorithm.
#### Isocracy
&emsp;A country where everyone has equal political power.
## By Power Ideology
### Monarchy
&emsp;A monarchy is a [form of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_government "Form of government") in which a group, generally a family representing a [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty"), embodies the country's [national identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity "National identity") and its head, the [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch"), exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([crowned republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowned_republic "Crowned republic")), to partial and restricted ([constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy "Constitutional monarchy")), to completely autocratic ([absolute monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy")). Traditionally the monarch's post is [inherited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_monarchy "Hereditary monarchy") and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [elective monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy "Elective monarchy") require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [legitimacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political) "Legitimacy (political)") is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [reign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign "Reign") is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.
#### Absolute Monarchy
&emsp;A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state") and [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government"). Many nations of Europe during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") were absolute monarchies. Modern examples include mainly Islamic countries such as [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), [UAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE "UAE"), [Oman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman "Oman"), [Brunei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei "Brunei") and one African country, [Eswatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini "Eswatini").
#### Constitutional Monarchy
&emsp;Also called parliamentary monarchy, the monarch's powers are limited by law or by a formal [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"), usually assigning them to those of the [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state"). Many modern developed countries, including the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway "Monarchy of Norway"), [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_Netherlands "Monarchy of the Netherlands"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Australia "Monarchy of Australia"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada "Monarchy of Canada"), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain "Monarchy of Spain") and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Japan "Monarchy of Japan"), are constitutional monarchy systems.
#### Crowned Republic
&emsp;A form of government where the monarch (and family) is an official ceremonial entity with no political power. The royal family and the monarch are intended to represent the country and may perform speeches or attend an important ceremonial events as a symbolical guide to the people, but hold no actual power in decision-making, appointments, _et cetera_.
#### Elective Monarchy
A form of government where the monarch is elected, a modern example being the [King of Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Cambodia "King of Cambodia"), who is chosen by the [Royal Council of the Throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Council_of_the_Throne "Royal Council of the Throne"); [Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City") is also often considered a modern elective monarchy.
### Republic
&emsp;A republic ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _[res publica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_publica "Res publica")_) is a [form of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_government "Form of government") in which the country is considered a "public matter", not the [private concern or property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_privata "Res privata") of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed"). Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch"). In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") (a [democratic republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_republic "Democratic republic")) and exercise power according to the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Rule of law") (a [constitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionalism "Constitutionalism") republic).
#### Constitutional Republic
&emsp;Republics where there is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") (an official document establishing the exact powers and restrictions of a nation and its government), and chosen by a vote amongst the populace. Typically, laws cannot be passed which violate said constitution, unless the constitution itself is altered by law. This theoretically serves to protect minority groups from being subjected to the [tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority "Tyranny of the majority"), or [mob rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlocracy "Ochlocracy"). Examples include [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), etc.
#### Democratic Republic
&emsp;Republics where the laws are ultimately decided by popular vote, whether by a body of elected representatives or directly by the public, and there is no restriction on which laws are passed so long as they have majority support. Constitutional law is either non-existent or poses little obstacle to legislation.
#### Federal Republic
&emsp;Republics that are a federation of states or provinces, where there is a national (federal) law encompassing the nation as a whole but where each state or province is free to legislate and enforce its own laws and affairs so long as they don't conflict with federal law. Examples include [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") and Nigeria.
#### Islamic Republic
&emsp;Republics purporting to be governed in accordance with Islamic law. [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"), [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania "Mauritania"), and [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan") are self-described Islamic republics (as of 2022). [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan "Afghanistan"), [Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Islamic_Republic_of_the_Comoros "Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros"), [Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Islamic_Republic_of_East_Turkestan "Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan"), were Islamic republics at one time but are no more.
#### Parliamentary Republic
&emsp;Republics, like [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") or [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), with an elected head of state, but where the head of state and head of government are kept separate with the head of government retaining most executive powers, or a head of state akin to a head of government, elected by a parliament.
#### Presidential Republic
&emsp;Republics with an elected head of state, where the head of state is also the head of the government. Examples include [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"), and [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia").
#### People's Republic
&emsp;Republics that include countries like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China") and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam "Vietnam") that are [de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure "De jure") governed for and by the people. The term _People's Republic_ is used to differentiate themselves from the earlier republic of their countries before the people's revolution, like the Republic of China.
#### Semi-Presidential Republic
&emsp;A Semi-presidential republic is a government system with power divided between a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government, used in countries like [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal "Portugal"), and [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine"). The president, elected by the people, symbolizes national unity and foreign policy while the prime minister is appointed by the president or elected by the parliament and handles daily administration. The term _semi-presidential_ distinguishes this system from presidential and parliamentary systems.
#### Directorial Republic
&emsp;A Directorial republic is a government system with power dived among a college of several people who jointly exercise the powers of a head of state and/or a head of government.
## By socio-economic influence
### Anarchism
&emsp;A system that advocates [self-governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance "Self-governance") societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as [stateless societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society "Stateless society"), although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy") or [free associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism) "Free association (communism and anarchism)"), while others have advocated for stateless societies with the inclusion of [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-Capitalism "Anarcho-Capitalism"), property rights and hierarchical groups, so long as membership and association with those groups are entirely [voluntary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism "Voluntaryism"). Anarchism holds the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") to be undesirable, unnecessary and/or harmful.
### Capitalism
&emsp;A system in which the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") (machines, tools, factories, etc.) are owned by private individuals, workers then negotiate with those individuals to use those means of production in exchange for a portion of what they produce, usually in the form of capital ([money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money "Money")). The owners of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") are entitled to whatever portion of the products of the workers' labor that is agreed upon by the two parties.
### Colonialism
&emsp;A system in which a native group (or their lands and resources) is subjugated by an external political power for their own economic and/or political benefit.
### Communism
&emsp;A socialist system in which the means of production are commonly owned (either by the people directly, through the commune, or by a [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") or [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_society "Communist society")), and production is undertaken [for use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_for_use "Production for use"), rather than [for profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)").Communist society is thus, in theory, [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society "Stateless society"), [classless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_society "Classless society"), moneyless, — it is usually regarded as the "final form" of a socialist or anarchist society.
### Despotism
&emsp;A system in which the laws and resources of a nation are controlled by one individual, usually a [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch") or [dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator "Dictator"), who holds absolute political power. Examples include the [pharaohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh "Pharaoh") of [Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"), the [Roman emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor "Roman emperor") and the [North Korean Supreme Leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title) "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)").
### Distributism
&emsp;A variant of capitalism which views widespread [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") ownership as fundamental right; the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") are spread as widely as possible rather than being centralized under the control of the state (as in [state socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism "State socialism")), or a few individuals/corporations (as in what proponents of distributism call "[crony capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism "Crony capitalism")") Distributism fundamentally opposes [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") and [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"),[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_forms_of_government#cite_note-52) which distributists view as equally flawed and exploitative. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life".
### Feudalism
&emsp;A system of land ownership and duties common to [medieval Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"). Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.

&emsp;A similar system is the [Iqta‘](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqta%27 "Iqta'"), used by medieval [Islamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic "Islamic") societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.
### Minarchism
&emsp;A variant of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") which advocates for the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [night-watchman state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state "Night-watchman state"), in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression "Aggression"), [theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft "Theft"), [breach of contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract "Breach of contract"), and [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud "Fraud") as defined by [property laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law "Property law"), limiting it to three institutions: the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military "Military"), the [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police "Police"), and [courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts "Courts").
### Monarchism
&emsp;A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility") who is known as the [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch "Monarch"), usually in the form of a [king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King "King") or [emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor "Emperor") (but also less commonly a [queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_regnant "Queen regnant") or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [inherited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_monarchy "Hereditary monarchy") from a previous ruler by [bloodline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity "Heredity") or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility") themselves, as was the case in the ancient [Roman Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom "Roman Kingdom") and the medieval [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire").
### Republicanism
&emsp;A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a "public matter" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be. Most modern nation-states are examples of republics, but other examples include those of ancient [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy "Athenian democracy").
### Socialism
&emsp;A system in which [workers, democratically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker%27s_self_management "Worker's self management") and/or [socially own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ownership "Social ownership") the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production"). The economic framework may be [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics) "Decentralized planning (economics)") and [self-managed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism#Self-managed_economy "Socialism") in autonomous economic units, as in [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism "Libertarian socialism") systems, or [centrally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_planning "Central planning") [planned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy "Planned economy"), as in [authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_socialism "Authoritarian socialism") systems. [Public services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service "Public service") such as [healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care "Universal health care") and [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_access_to_education "Universal access to education") would be [commonly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership "Common ownership"), [collectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_ownership "Collective ownership"), and/or [state owned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership "State ownership").
### Totalitarianism
&emsp;A system in which opposition is prohibited, civil rights are extremely suppressed and virtually all aspects of social life, including the economy, morals, and private lives of citizens, are controlled by a centralized [authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian "Authoritarian") [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") that holds absolute political power, usually under a [dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship "Dictatorship") or [single political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state"). Five examples are the [Soviet Union (1927-53)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1927%E2%80%931953) "History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)"), [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"), [Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"), [Eritrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea "Eritrea") and [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea").
### Tribalism
&emsp;A system based on a small complex society of varying degrees of centralisation that is led by an individual known as a chief.
## By Geo-cultural influence
### National Government 
&emsp;The [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") of a [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-state "Nation-state") and is a characteristic of a [unitary state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state "Unitary state"). This is the same thing as a [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation "Federation") which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution") or other law.
### City-State
&emsp;A [sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state"), also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome "Rome"), [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens"), [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage "Carthage"), and the [Italian city-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_city-states "Italian city-states") during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"). Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore"), [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco "Monaco"), and [Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City "Vatican City"). City states are also sometimes called [micro-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-state "Micro-state") which however also includes other configurations of very small countries.
### Commune
&emsp;From the [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") _[communia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communia "Communia")._ An [intentional community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community "Intentional community") of people living together, sharing common interests, often having common values and beliefs, as well as shared [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property "Property"), possessions, [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources "Resources"), and, in some communes, [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment "Employment"), [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income "Income") or [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assets "Assets").
### Intergovernmental Organisations
&emsp;Also known as international governmental organizations (IGOs): the type of organization most closely associated with the term 'international organization', these are organizations that are made up primarily of [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state") (referred to as [member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state "Member state")). Notable examples include the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") (UN), [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe") (OSCE), [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe "Council of Europe") (COE), [International Labour Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization") (ILO) and [International Police Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol "Interpol") (INTERPOL). The UN has used the term "intergovernmental organization" instead of "international organization" for clarity.
### World Government
&emsp;The notion of a common [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political "Political") authority for all of humanity, yielding a global [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") and a single [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") that exercises [authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority "Authority") over the entire [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). Such a government could come into existence either through violent and compulsory [world domination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_domination "World domination") or through peaceful and voluntary [supranational union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union "Supranational union").
