##### BER 40,000 - 35,000 (First Epoch)

  At this point in the distant past, the very first identifiable dwellings can be located not at the foot of [[Sha'yvra]] the greatest of the Spirecities, but instead upon the edge of a gentle, but expansive valley known as Huia’els. The prevailing theory is that this valley was once home a lake that teemed with freshwater fauna, based on what few fossils of ancient life were discovered there, as well as evidence of fenceposts which defined not merely the outline of the dwellings themselves, but of large rectangular structures which might have been piers. At the most generous estimations, Huia’els might once have housed as many as three thousand at its peak, based on the peculiar method of expansion; rather than having a central plaza and expanding outwards from it, the settlement instead expanded along the banks of the lake itself, leading to the initial conjecture that the scattering of dwellings was many smaller hamlets, rather than a single city of ancient proportions.   The discovery of Huia’els was of course, just the first step to uncovering the far distant past, as soon many more settlements of equal or smaller scale were discovered, pockmarked around ancient lakebeds and long-dried up rivers. The advantage of constructing a permanent settlement beside any body of water cannot be understated, but as always, the Pioneers like to speculate, and are often heard discussing the merit that the life-giving waters of their home held a more ceremonial, if not theological significance.
