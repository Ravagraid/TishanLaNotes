## Introduction

The Kaluk Dathal are a terrestrial species that, as strange as that sounds, that began upon the world of [Tishan'La](Locations/Stellar/Planets/Tishan%27La%20%28World%29.md). It is said they fell upon the world in an orb of blackest pitch, landed upon a circular valley, and spread beneath the very earth like malignant roots.

As far as biology allows, they are understood to be possessed of a single cell structure, and thusly are more akin to a colony, or an insect hive of flesh, guided by a consciousness within their form. Behind that consciousness of the self is an even greater, lesser known intelligence that acts as a gestalt, without a loss of self-awareness in each member of the species. Thusly, the Kaluk Dathal can be considered sapient, on par with the greatest minds of Tishan'La, though perhaps, the gestalt itself may be even greater.

They are few in number, of course, as their kind are rightfully feared as horrors that snatch the bodies of others, corrupt and capture and contort, only to replace it wholesale as a masquerade-form. Thusly then, why do they persist? If one were to ask, they would reply; To End.

## Generic

### Origin / Ancestry

It is often said that the origins of the Kaluk Dathal are strange, and mysterious. A mixture of history and mythology. In order to explain as simply as possible, this shall be explained in two parts. The first, and simplest, is here. The second is contained a seperate [document](Appendix/kaluk-dathal-origins.md), a while longer, presents the tale of their beginning more poetically.

The Kaluk Dathal began when an entity, a creature from beyond the bounds of reality, saw creation and wanted to devour it. Due to some unknown means, it could not, and thus broke off a small fragment of itself, and hurled it into a tiny crack in the skin of the universe.

This fragment found a world teeming with primitive life; Tishanâ€™La. It looked upon this world and saw something in its people, something it could use. Thus, it cast down a fragment of itself upon the world, and waited in the cold depths of space, for its seeds to bear fruit.

This seed of the dark imbedded itself upon the world, and oozed a foul liquid within the crater it created. This pool was found by the local inhabitants, tribesmen of a less developed time. They came in ones, drawn by the fire in the sky that fell to the earth.

This would be their downfall, and their doom, as twelve would fall victim to the pool, and these twelve would be bodies and minds stolen, then corrupted, into the first of the Kaluk Dathal.

### Geographic Distribution

TODO: (Add Homeworld section here) Expand distribution of species

By virtue of their subterranean tendencies and lack of any true record of their number, it is assumed that there is at least the presence of a Cluster, or a gathering of two dozen, on every world, every continent, every province within the Empire of Tishan'La.
