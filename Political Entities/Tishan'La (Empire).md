# Tishan'La (Empire)
<small>Pronunciation: (Shi-An-La)</small>
<small>Type: Geopolitical, Empire</small>

## Introduction
&emsp;The Empire of Tishan’La is a sovereign, interstellar nation state that spans three Spheres thus far, with plans to expand further afield into what has commonly been called the [[Far Realms]], a zone of space that surrounds the Empire proper, and is home to a myriad of rumours, secrets, and other creatures that dwell within the empty void. The Empire itself has conducted many a census in the past, but due to clerical errors, Byzantine bureaucracy, and in some cases the destruction of the records wholesale, the exact number of individuals within the Empire cannot be ascertained. Due to this, only an approximation from prior attempts at a national census, currently exists. This number, though widely disputed by many, ranges between 39 and 40 billion souls at its current peak, though there have been instances where that number was drastically reduced, to half if not less.

&emsp;The government functions much like a feudal empire, where power is held supremely by the [[Lord Imperatorius]] first, then trickled down to the many ranks beneath him. While this system might mirror the governments of old in many respects, the Empire is still more centralised than its appearance might suggest, as per royal decree, a census of each region is undertaken every [[Tishan'La'Ni Calendar|Decia]], or decade, to ensure that the funds of the [[Tishan'La (World)|Throneworld]] are spent only in areas where it is most necessary to do so.

&emsp;Due to the nature of governing such a vast territory, the Empire runs through a form of tithe, or taxation in which those nobles of the [[Lords Proliferate]] must pay a tax. This tax can be given in many ways, determined by the needs of the empire, and the whims of its ruler, whether it be material wealth, a labour force, or even in a standing military force. Those that do not are swiftly rebuked, and in prior epochs, such disdainful behaviour has even brought about reproach of a most violent nature, to instil fear, or to install another noble in place of the old. This has led to many a regional regime change, though few are loath to admit to such a thing.

&emsp;One area of note is its people, the stalwart shianlani, or [[Tishan'La'Ni (Culture)|Tishan’La’Ni]], in their local tongue. They are a people born of hard times and harsher conditions, as due to the fragmented nature of both their realm, and their many cultures across such a vast territory, disputes often run rampant, if left unchecked. However, despite such obvious shortcomings in their capacity to work together, they as a people believe in the unity of the nation above even cultural identity and ethnicity. They may have a streak of independence about them, but it is this unity of purpose, this collective pride in themselves as a nation, that allows them to see past such petty things when the need arises.

## General information
### Motto/Slogan/Axiom
&emsp;“Once We Fell, Now We Rise!” — If one were to look upon the heraldry of Tishan'La as an empire, they would see these words, bold and brazen beneath the banner that depicts their three suns. It is a statement about their past, about their grand fall from grace, and their claim to rise not only onto the pedestal that they once occupied, but to go beyond even that; into the heavens themselves.

### Alternative Names
&emsp;The Solar Empire Of Tishan'La; To outside polities, this official name given to the empire, during negotiations. However, as an odd quirk of the spoken language of the empire, those within its borders simply refer to it as Tishan'La.

### Demonym
&emsp;The correct term for those belonging to the Empire are Tishan'La'Ni, though this term has a double meaning, depending on the context in which it is said. In fact, there are actually two kinds of Tishan'La'Ni, the [[Tishan'La'Ni (Culture)| culture]], and the [[Tishan'La'Ni (Species)|species]].

### Current Ruler & Title
&emsp;The reigning ruler of the empire is the [[Lord Imperatorius]], [[Levariel Demorial]], a divisive figure that's lorded by some as divinity made manifest, and by others as a tyrannical overlord, whose iron grip on the empire is what truly prevents it from spreading into the greater cosmos.

### Recognised Subjects
&emsp;The majority population is [[Tishan'La'Ni (Species)|Tishan'La'Ni]], totalling perhaps 75 to 80 percent of the empire, followed by minority populations of [[Kahlkili]], [[Saurita]], [[Yiale]], [[Dekarln]], and [[Ceehur]], in no particular order.

### Recognised Ethnicities
&emsp;While listing every ethnicity within the empire might be an impossible task, due to just how many groups exist within the empires borders, though with that being said, the shared identity of the empire is of course, [[Tishan'La'Ni (Culture)|Tishan'La'Ni]], though often this is conflated with national identity, or as some would say; “I may be Ceehur, but I am Tishan'La'Ni, same as you.”

&emsp;Beyond belonging to the empire's group, some cultures have persisted since before their absorption into the empire proper, such as the Kahlkili, whose cultural ties to their [[Great Tapestry]] defy even the understanding of the most expert of scholars. Though perhaps the most prominent divide in their culture, is that of [[The Hive]], and [[The Hiveless]], whose constant internal struggles often leave carnage in their wake.

&emsp;Contrasting these otherwise centralised cultural identities, the Yiale are, by their nature, fragmentary, with each flock holding its own ties, its own customs and ceremonies. In some cases, even their own version of the greater Yiale tongue, which for the sake of completeness, is known as [[Yiaiasian]], or “Sounds of the Yia.”

### Organisational Structure
&emsp;As has been mentioned before, power within the empire is exercised from the highest authority, then channelled through other organisations, individuals, and positions of note to affect real change upon its many peoples. The structure of the empire, in broad strokes, can  be laid out as follows;
- [[Lord Imperatorius|The Lord Imperatorius]]: The highest seat of power, rule undisputed and guardian of the Empire in action, if not in name. Whomsoever holds this title is granted the remit to write laws, conduct vast scientific, economic, and political projects without equal. It is a title held only by those who can unify an Empire, and those that wish for such a thing, do so with an envy unparalleled.
- [[Council Empyrean|The Council Empyrean]]: The upkeep of an empire is no small task, and certainly impossible for just a single individual to manage, thus, the Lord Imperatorius has a council of trusted advisors, chosen principally for their integrity and prior sacrifices made for the nation. There are seven members of the council in total, with each having a distinct title and responsibility both to the state, and to the Lord Imperatorius. Over informal channels, the Council is often referred to as the Keepers, as they are the guardians of Tishan'La, from its majestic heights, to its disastrous follies.
  - [[Keeper Of Visions]]: Responsible for infrastructure, construction and manufacturing pursuits, including extra-solar stations and other artificial constructs. When a great structure is established in the influence of a Sphere, or Wanderer, it is typically the responsibility of this Keeper to ensure that such matters are handled with an eye towards perfection, and expediency. Currently, the reformation of infrastructure on the Throneworld takes up most, if not all of their time.
  - [[Keeper Of Bulwarks]]: Sovereign nations, by their very nature, are little more than concepts without the presence of some form of defence initiative, a way of ensuring primacy over one's opponents so that political tension never passes beyond snide remarks over backroom dealings. The Keeper of Bulwarks, then, is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and development of a military presence that allows for the projection of power beyond the nation's borders, and peacekeeping within. Currently, these defence programs have suffered from a severe lack of funding, due in part to the relative period of peace that the empire is in the midst of, and enforced by royal decree.
  - [[Keeper Of Labour]]: While one might consider a humble profession like farming to be far too below them, or the ignoble cistern worker to be nothing short of a deplorable position to be in, it is too often the case that these jobs are necessary to the running of a functioning, maintained society. Such tasks, and many more that are needed, but not wanted, are under the purview of this Keeper, and while misunderstood by those of a higher social stratum, they are nonetheless, Tishan’La’Ni deserving of some form of acknowledgement on the part of the Council.
  - [[Keeper Of Paths]]: Some might consider the lauded Pioneers and their many accomplishments to be little more than relics of a bygone age, where the establishment of commerce and great constructions to further the aims of other, more important areas of Tishan’La’Ni society. This, of course, would be wrong. The Pioneers, through careful handling of their assets and displacement, have proven time and again to be a valuable resource, and thus was the position of the Paths created, to better guide this wayward group to new, ever expanding horizons.
  - [[Keeper Of Voices]]: Before the most recent attempt on the Lord Imperatorius’ life there were but six seats to the Council Empyrean, which is, at least in part, what lead to the attempt in the first place. The Council had no dedicated position relating to spycraft, subterfuge or obfuscation. This was soon rectified both with the expansion of the Council, and the formation of a secretive society, whose purpose was to ensure a measure of compliance and surveillance amongst the higher echelons of society.
  - [[Keeper Of Coin]]: Perhaps the most clearly defined role of all that sit on the council, the Keeper of Coins principle responsibility is the understanding of market dynamics, commercial forces and the oversight of commerce, so that the Empire maintains its funding through means other than tithing, as a safety net in regard to the Imperial Budget. Curiously, this position is given to nobility who have a penchant for a measure of discretion, rather than the more grandiose or ostentatious.
   - [[Keeper Of Beasts]]: In truth, this is a position of yesteryear, when Tishan’La held a more aggressive stance towards those that did not conform to societal norms, whether they be the nation's own, or those curious creatures that came from the Far Realms, or even beyond them. The exact nature of this position is known only to the Keeper themselves, and to the Lord Imperatorius, who has in some cases, taken to calling the holder The Tamer.
- [[Lords Proliferate|The Lords Proliferate]]: These lords number just short of a thousand in total, each holding hereditary titles or claims over territory, and function much like feudal lords of yore because of this. While individually, the Lords are granted autonomy second only to the Council, their power is kept in check by clandestine Bondsmen, as envoys or emissaries of the Empyrean itself.
- [[Council Bondsmen]]:  One of the more curious aspects of Tishan’La’Ni society is that from a social standing, the countless Lords of the vast territories of Tishan’La are held in as much regard as the Council Bondsmen themselves. This may be in part due to the fact that the Council Bonds are chosen by the Empyrean Lords, and thus hold a certain amount of protection from the free reign of other, more noble powers, which runs opposite of the notion that the Lords themselves have the authority to do as they please, for the most part.<br>&emsp;Bondsmen are, as their name would suggest, bound to a specific duty through a contract verbal, written, or aetheric, depending on the gravity of the station they have chosen to adopt. While bondsmen exist in all corners of Tishan’La’Ni society, there remains a group who through sheer dedication to their work, and to the work of the Empire as a whole, have been recognised by beings as prestigious as the Empyreans themselves.
- [[The Commonfolk]]: Beneath the nobility and their air of authority, beneath the byzantine bureaucracy of the Imperial Household and its dizzying heights exists the commonfolk, the myriad races of man whose very existence is the backbone of an Empire that spans literal star systems. They are the average craftsman, the merchant, the common soldiery, they are the overwhelming majority of sapient life that call Tishan’La their home.
  - [[Bondsmen]]: While they aren’t a distinct social class unto themselves, unlike the Councilmen, as some have taken to calling them, Bondsmen are no less important for the purposes of understanding the hierarchy of Tishan’La as a whole. In simple terms, they are commonfolk who through verbal, written, or aetheric contract, have chosen to give up some measure of their autonomy in order to render themselves servants or subjects of another. There are many reasons for this, such as to pay off a debt, or to prove ones self worthy of a higher station, but one thing remains consistent amongst Bondsmen; their position is temporary, unlike that of the Beasts below.
  - [[Beasts]]: What minority of the population constitutes beasts are perhaps the single-worst kept secret of all Tishan’La. They are a class of people that, for all intents and purposes, is ignored by every other. They are the conquered, they are the enslaved, they are those sorry few that sacrificed and gave up.. Everything, for another. It is often said that only those in positions of power would even dare to have Beasts, due to the implications of doing so. In fact, rumour often spreads of the Lord Imperatorius, and his more.. Devious tendencies in this regard.

### Culture
&emsp;Tishan’La’Ni society is, as one might garner from the rather two-faced nature of the Empire and its people, a conflicting mess of cultural norms and ancient tradition which clashes with a new, modern age in which cohesion on every level comes before personal gain, as one must be capable of conforming to an already established system, before they can begin to enact change upon it. In other, more contemporary cultures, the phrase most associated with this sort of conformity to a pre-established structure would be; don’t rock the boat. As such, culture of the Empire Tishan’La’Ni society can be broken down into three key pillars, each typified by one of the [[Three Spheres]] that rule the skies of the Empire.

&emsp;The first is Fauhs, or Pride. This can be pride in one's self, pride in one's family, or pride in the empire, but above all else, pride in accomplishments and self-sacrifice, as only such dedication to a cause could be rewarded, whilst selfishness is looked down upon. This has, in turn, sadly brought about something of a divide between the older and younger generations, as the young has yet to experience the misfortune of surrendering certain values all to be able to survive such hostile times. The gap of experience that exists is unlikely to ever be reconciled, with the young having warped this pillar into pride in one's self for self-sacrifice, while the old purport to take pride in the accomplishments of the nation as a whole.

&emsp;The second pillar of Suaed, or Compassion, might at first seem the opposite of self-sacrifice and Pride, as those incapable of helping themselves would have no hope in a land where they are expected to steel themselves through rigorous labour. However, compassion comes in many forms, and it is only through dedication that one can prosper, and thus show mercy to others by sharing what surplus they have. It is commonplace, though not mandatory, for households to perform acts of charity without the need for fanfare or grandiose gestures of benevolence in an effort to benefit the community they themselves are a part of. This isn’t always the case, as the desire to provide for one's fellow man is often supplanted by the necessity of maintaining the nation state. That being said, perhaps that is the purpose of Suaed, to encourage the commonfolk to care more for one's fellows, so that those in power might play their role more effectively.

&emsp;Lastly, is the pillar of Gaieh, whose direct translation is vague, but may refer to Honour, or Duty, depending on the territory or social status of the person one might be asking. This pillar refers to the acts that one undertakes, and where one places the action they undertake, on a scale from selfish, to selfless. Unlike the previous two pillars, Gaieh holds a universal appeal and reverence as opposed to a clearly defined, or merely vague, division between those that had to endure hardship, and those who reaped the benefits of a relatively peaceful reformation. This has, of course, lead to a divergence of a sort, with the young seeking duty to further ones self and those they care most for, as opposed to the honourbound familial ties of the older, yet neither side, true to the stubbornness of the Tishan’La’Ni, will only accept the merits of the other when an outside threat is presented.

### Public Agenda
&emsp;At present, the empire promotes, in near totality, a regime of growth, expansion, and reformation through targetted expenditures of wealth in the pursuit of narrowed goals. The reasoning for this is a fairly simple one; to concentrate efforts where they are most needed, as opposed to casting a wide net over all areas of major concern. Where some polities would choose to hoard their wealth within the ivory towers of the upper nobility, the Empyreans themselves use the wealth of the nation to further improve the lives of those within it. Or to suppress the dissidents that would seek to topple what the Lord Imperatorius had built.

&emsp;It is said that the gears of imperial mandate grind ever so slowly, and they would be correct in this regard, as those afore mentioned meetings take place every five years, prior to the [[Starbinding Festival]]. 

## Historical

### Founding Date
### Dissolution Date

### Founders
The founder of the empire in its present state is the [[Lord Imperatorious, Levariel Demorial]].

### History
&emsp;It is often said that history, no matter how torturous, no matter how humiliating or mundane, no matter the horrors of endless conflict and the death toll of countless different ideologies that, through the simple fact of their very existence, is somehow written by the victor. If that were in fact the case, then Tishan’La is quite clearly the victim of countless cataclysms, brought about not through internecine warfare, but through unprovoked invasions by evils far greater than those that ruled from their cerulean towers. 

&emsp;Theirs is a history painted red, dripping with an ever-present flow of crimson from conflict that reaches back tens of thousands of solar years, by the calendar of the empire. It is layer upon layer of battleground, unearthed weaponry, and failed attempts at landing a last decisive blow in a conflict that lasted for much, much longer than it had any right to.

&emsp;As one might have surmised from such strong use of emotive language, the notion that one can garner an unbiased view of the history of such a resilient people should be considered impossible. That is, it weren’t for one of the lesser-known functions of the Keeper of Paths; the safeguarding of knowledge, and the sanctification of what one might consider to be the only true history of the Empire. It is thanks to this that there exists, in any form, accounts of those fateful conflicts of yesteryear. However, as is often the case with the passage of time, the further back one ventures, the less precise the account becomes.

&emsp;What history is known, is suffixed with the denomination of [[Tishan'La'Ni Calendar|Be’ah eah’zhusa]], or when properly translated, Time Before the Era of Rebuilding, and thus abbreviated as BER (Before Era of Rebuilding) to understand the timescales involved.
