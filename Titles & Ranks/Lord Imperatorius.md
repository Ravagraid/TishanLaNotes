## Introduction
&emsp;The title of Lord Imperatorius has a long and storied history, dating back to the very beginnings of Tishan'La, as something to denote he who had painstakingly unified the many tribal states of the land. Sadly, however, this meant that there could be more than one figure that could claim the title for themselves, having united or subsumed various warring factions under the same banner. In truth, it would be this very epoch of small and disparate nations, vying for power, material wealth and prestige, that would usher in the next incarnation of Lord Imperatorius.

&emsp;The second incarnation, or some would say, Second Epoch, of Tishan'La came when the then reigning Lord Imperatorius, one [[Traexar Scrix]], had, after a long and brutal campaign, finally succeeded in his goal of conquering the last of the nations of Tishan'La that had been able to defy him. Of course, after unifying all the lands of the world, therein came the question of what to do when the current Lord would die. How would the title be passed on? Who would be qualified to grant such a prestigious title? And most importantly, how could such a succession be guaranteed without the necessity of shedding blood to protect one's birthright?

&emsp;The solution was truthfully a simple thing, as it required little more than the current holder of the title, dictating whom their immediate successor would be, and then determining whom their three adjutants would be, to serve as retainers, and as replacements for the Uncrowned Lord, should he be unable to attain the title of Lord Imperatorius when the time came. While it wasn't the most robust system of succession, it served its purpose during the Heavenward Expansion, as the first solar craft rose to discover new, and sometimes wholly untouched lands in the great [[Endless Sea]].

&emsp;Thus began the Third Epoch, as more and more realms were formed, the remit of the Lord Imperatorius grew, as did his responsibilities. Thusly did one such man, known as [[Trascka The Explorer]] establish what was called the [[Frontier Council]] in an attempt to provide the quickly growing [[Border Colonies]] with a form of self-governance. Alongside this, he also founded the [[Frontier Watch]] in an attempt to better safeguard those far away colonies that couldn't otherwise defend themselves.

&emsp;During the Fourth Epoch, or the Worldrend, as some had taken to calling it at the time, the role was torn down, along with the Lords seat of power, in an attempt to sow yet further chaos during the apocalyptic endtimes that had befallen the Empire. It wouldn't be for several decades until a claimant stepped forward, and only once the fires of war had died down, and left nothing but ash and ember for the survivors to sift through. Here, the title would pass to its current holder, one [[Levariel Demorial]], thanks in part to his efforts to unite what pitiful fragments remained of [Tishan'La](../Organisations/Political/Tishan'La%20(Empire).md) into what would be a mere shadow of its former self. At least, it would remain that way for many a year, before it would rise once more.

&emsp;Thus we come to the reign of the current Lord, He who sits upon the worldthrone, and rules from within the innermost chamber of the tallest [[Spire]]. A reign that as of yet has proven to be the most tumultuous of the Five Epochs.
