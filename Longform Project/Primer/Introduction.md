# Tishan'La: A Primer

## Foreword
&emsp;Tishan'La as a project has weighed heavy on my mind, these many, many years. It was my first true foray into creative writing, and its earliest interpretations left plenty to be desired in terms of.. Well, anything remotely related to worldbuilding! While there have been many half-finished projects, a lot of trial and error, and countless attempts at writing something that even vaguely resembles a coherent narrative, I feel proud, elated even, at the conclusion of this first real dive into the setting of Tishan'La, its myriad worlds, and its many peoples all living their lives as best as they can manage.

&emsp;There will, of course, be many, many inspirations behind this work, and the astute among those who read will either smirk at their mention, or sigh and roll their eyes at what veiled references dot the page. Regardless, as an author to a reader, perhaps one who wishes to take part in this grand tale, or perhaps as little more than a passing curiosity; thank you, for taking the time to at least get this far.

## Introduction
&emsp;The setting of Tishan'La encompasses three distinct star systems, bound together within the borders of an interstellar empire whose ambitions reach beyond its borders. By its nature, the Empire is expansionist, and by the day it presses ever further into the cold, dark, empty sea of space.

&emsp;The population of this Empire is vast, spread between a dozen worlds, many smaller planetoids, and an uncountable number of vessels that sail through the empty sea, unburdened by the natural laws of the land that they once called home. Of course, the Empire itself is made up of many cultures, theologies, histories, and even vastly different species that have come to call its borders home. Some, more willingly than others.

&emsp;The worlds themselves are pockmarked with striking, gleaming cities of smooth teal stone, whose glassy surface appears as but a thin skin that hides a vibrant, radiant shade of green-blue. In some places, notably on the [[Throneworld]] itself, these structures can soar into the very heavens, scraping against the very edge of the atmosphere.

&emsp;Flora and fauna too, are abundant across great plains of rolling lilac grass, burdened by the blazing warmth of a blood-red sun. Likewise, the oceans teem with all manner of fish, crustacean and invertebrate. Though perhaps, most curious of all are the leviathans, rumoured beasts of prodigious size and scale, whose very footprint can only be seen from above.

&emsp;Governing this world is the [Lord Imperatorius](../../Titles%20&%20Ranks/Lord%20Imperatorius.md), an enigmatic figure, supported by a trusted council of [[Keepers]] who are, likewise, rarely seen within the public domain, instead choosing to rule by trusted proxies and underlings, whose power becomes more diluted the further that one travels down the line of authority.

&emsp;As a result of this intentional choice, Tishan'La is largely feudal in how it is governed, with Lords upon Lords, Nobility upon Nobility, stacked atop one another with varying degrees of control over their respective demesne.
