## Introduction

<small>Ruling Body: [Tishan'La (Empire)](../../Organisations/Political/Tishan'La%20(Empire).md)</small>
<small>Contested Claims:</small>

&emsp;The Three Spheres, as they are commonly referred to, are a trio of suns that are within a close enough proximity of each other to allow for the connection of a series of [[Pathways]] as a method of near-instantaneous transportation. Of course, this isn't the only method, as there are the countless courier [[Gliders]] and unmanned [[Pathfinder]] vessels that move between the Three Spheres in pre-determined routes. The routes between each Sphere have no official name, besides commonly the commonly accepted term of [[Road]].

&emsp;While the domain of Tishan'La does in fact extend beyond the Three Spheres into smaller, less populated regions, commonly referred to as the [[Far Realms]]. These realms are as small as one might expect, with some being little more than an outpost housing a half-dozen.

&emsp;As is so frequently the case with interstellar bodies, the three are often used as focal points of reverence and worship from many [[Solar Cults]], as well as the three most prominent faiths that exist within the empire, those being; [[The Followers of Shalei'Kah]], [[The Sustained Church]], and [[The Disciples]].

&emsp;The Three Sphere consist of a trio of solar systems, each of which house a number of planets, moons, notable celestial phenomena, and smaller, artificial constructs. Collectively, the Three Spheres contains an overwhelming majority of the population of [Tishan'La (Empire)](../../Organisations/Political/Tishan'La%20(Empire).md), though some hold a higher population than others, and thusly are regularly overlooked, in certain circles of society. Each Sphere, and the significant celestial bodies that orbit them, are listed here.

## Nalre'sah
&emsp;Nalre'sah is a great, red star with a baleful gaze, and is often referred to as the most boastful of the three, with its respective faith [[The Disciples]] having a tendency to be overly proud, sometimes to the point of shunning those denizens of the other Spheres, let alone outsiders from the [[Far Realms]] and beyond. Due to the fact that the Throneworld orbits this Sphere in particular, it has both a higher total population, and higher rate of immigration than its fellow Spheres of the Empire.
- [[Vaetra'fei]]: Due to the immense amount of heat that this planet must endure, its surface has been rendered into something akin to a smooth, glassy material, and is frequently called the [[Godstear]] (God's Tear), in reference to an ancient tale in which noble Narle'sah did weep for her children. On some bright days, patient and well-protected observers might be able to see this glistening white dot, to contrast an otherwise wholly violent star.
<br>
- [[Gresha'el]]: While not as close to the star as Vaetra'fei, the amount of heat that the star radiates, suggests that the surface water of this sand dune covered world evaporated away, many eons ago. What evidence of habitation remains, are hidden within the few canyons and crevices that pockmark an otherwise desert swept realm. These settlements, while few, seem to have once been capable of housing tens, if not hundreds of thousands within their vast, cavernous expanses. Very few expeditions have been sent, and even fewer have returned.
<br>
- [Tishan'La](Stellar/Tishan'La%20(World).md): Noble Tishan'La, a temperate world of verdant forests and fields of bright, purple grass that sway in the gentle breeze. This is the birthplace of the Tishan'La'Ni, from whence the Empire did rise to the stars in earlier epochs and which continues to be the hub of the wheel, as it were. Though of all its characteristically unique landmarks, what one will notice first is the great, monolithic structures that pierce the heavens themselves. To the denizens of the Empire, they are simply known as [[Spire|The Spires]].
	<br>
	- [[Tishae'va]]: The first moon of the Throneworld, Tishae'va is most commonly referred to as the First Frontier, due to it being the first point of expansion during the first excursions into the endless sea. Together with its sister moon, they are called [[The Twins]] due to their uncanny similarities in appearance, and mineral wealth. It is considered to be the most populated of the two, which has lead to an unofficial competition between quantity, and quality. Curiously, as a result of its quantity doctrine, Tishae'va has actually been hollowed out, in favour of more living space.
	<br>
	- [[Tishli'va]]: The second celestial body to be claimed for Tishan'La marked a turning point, where those brave souls that journeyed this far would dare to dream of yet further expansion. There's a certain kind of wanderlust that's characteristic of those that still dwell upon this moon, which has lead to a distinctly lower population than that of its sister. The pair have a distinctly grey, dusty appearance, littered with craters for many an extra-solar impact, which to this day, has provided both with a substantial mineral wealth.

<br>

- [[Daesa’dal]]: Far from the star dwells a great, gaseous realm, a swirling mass of toxic fumes and airborne beasts that shriek and wail in an otherwise poisonous atmosphere. No living soul has delved into the depths of this place and returned, though many still brave the excessive storms to harvest the carcasses of dead [[Daesabeasts]]. In its orbit are many small moons, with some estimates placing the number at upwards of 20.
	<br>
	- [[Sahle'va]]: The largest and closest of Daesa'dals many moons, it is, in fact, artificial. Thanks to advancements in the manipulation of natural laws, this construct is capable of using its rather eccentric orbit to separate whole swathes of the surface from its parent, to allow for the stranding and harvesting of many a beast. The damage this single creation has caused to the population of the Daesabeasts is unknown, and likely never will be.
	<br>
	 - [[Grahle'vari‌]]: What might have once been a moon resides here, as little more than scattered fragments of barren rocks that circle this great, tumultuous giant, though this is not what makes so mundane a body so curious. Rather, it is the fact that this collection of asteroids has an orbit that is perpendicular to the elliptical plane of Daesa'dal. How such a phenomenon came into being is unknown, though there are some theories.
	 <br>
	 - [[Gilas'Vael]]: Whereas other stellar bodies are visible to the naked eye, this one is not. In fact, there is a distinct absence of anything except for the telltale gravitational pull of something existing within its orbital plane. Due to its assumed denseness, any true attempt to identify the cause has proven fruitless.
	 <br>
- [[Fesre’ka]]: In stark contrast to the desert worlds of the inner system, what dwells beyond the reach and interest of many, is a lonely planet of ice, and cold, and eternal night, lit only by what few sources have been maintained by only the most stalwart of Pioneers. Due to the relatively unknown nature of this world, rumours abound of monstrously large creatures, which can sometimes be seen moving, if one were to remain in high orbit.
<br>
- [[Arctae'so]]: Beyond the reach of many, exists a curious and ponderous construction, likened to that of a swarm of disc-shaped objects that can sometimes be seen glinting in what little solar light still reaches this dark and empty void. Their origin, beyond their clearly crafted structure, is unknown, for as quickly as they are seen, they vanish into the blackness, only to reappear once more in another, but seemly random location. Due to their nature, onlookers have often referred to this cloud as simply The Swarm.

## Jhae'sah
&emsp;Of the Three Spheres, Jhae'sah is the smallest and produces the least amount of light, being that of a cool, pale blue that will pulsate on a predictable cycle. The combination of these two properties has led to a very specific sort of character, both in regard to the people that look up to this Sphere, and to the worlds that are caught in its grasp.
- [[Jhri'so]]:Due to the overabundance of curiosities that exist within the influence of this Sphere, a structure was built, not simply within proximity, but upon the surface of the Sphere itself, despite the overwhelming heat and incredible pull. It is, in essence, a [Spire](Spire), comparable in scale to the Spires of the Throneworld itself and likely to be made out of a similar material, if not the very same. Due to the hazardous nature of both the Sphere, and the approach to the Spire thanks to the waves of the Spheres influence, the Spire itself is considered to be self-sufficient. However, a scarce few turns of Tishan’La since its installation, all communication has ceased.
<br>
- [[Fause'ca]]: With such a close proximity toso dense a star, the world of Fause'ca is a dense, compact sphere of a hardened crystalline structure, sharing a very sobering similarity to the material used in the Spires themselves. Whether this is in fact the origin of the monolithic constructs, is discussed to this day. What is known, is that there are great ravines along its surface, as though some unfathomable beast dragged its monstrous talons across its shimmering, cerulean surface.
	<br>
	- [[Laahe’vari]]: While the landmass of Fause’ca might not be suitable for permanent habitation, save for those few creatures hardy enough to sustain a form of life in so caustic and environ, its sphere of influence is not without its merit. As the planet itself is nothing less than the largest deposit of one of the single-most valuable resources known to the Empire, the [[Great Ring of Laahe’vari]] was created; a ring of connected stations, designed to rotate around the planet at varying angles, to extract the richest deposits from the planets surface.
	<br>
- [[Graeja’eh]]: One might be mistaken when gazing upon this world, with its bright blue oceans that are teeming with life, from the smallest of [[Craea]] to the positively monolithic [[Hlashe]] whose immense bulk through simply surfacing, can cause waves the size of many men to roll across an otherwise calm, quiet sea. So vast are the oceans of this world that in truth, the only landmasses that do exist are scattered collections of archipelagoes that line the still-shifting tectonic plates of this living, breathing ecosystem. Curious still are the rumours that rise from the depths, of something grander, something more vast than any naturally born sea creature. A veritable [[God Of The Seas]], made of a conglomerate of the many corpses that fell to the seafloor. This rumours are as of yet, unsubstantiated.
	<br>
	- [[Cahel’va]]: While Graeja’eh is often considered to be the breadbasket of the Empire, at least in terms of marine life, the lack of any substantial landmass makes permanent habitation an impossibility without an immense commitment to colonisation. This, in turn, lead to the creation of permanent dwellings upon its moon instead, ruled over by a cabal of mercantile [[Fisher Barons]] who have thus far been largely left alone to pursue their own financial interests.
	<br>
	- [[Fashu’vari]]: In high orbit around this waterworld are a series of small, autonomous craft with but one purpose; to monitor the endless oceans and its myriad species. The accepted story is that they are little more than survey craft, designed to pinpoint the richest schools of fauna for harvest, yet still some rumours of an ulterior motive persist. It has to be said that it wasn’t the Barons that set up this network, but rather another, more official body of government.
	<br>
- [[Huael’la]]: It is often said that the Three Sisters are fickle, driven to moments of rage, of fury in moments of vulnerability, as one might witness in their fellow man. Thus, it is the view of some that they were responsible for the travesty that befell this world. In short, a cataclysm occured that shook the world to such an extent, that what little remains is naught but fragmentary landmasses, suspended in orbit around a solid black mass that might once have been the planets core. Curiously though, these floating islands are themselves entirely habitable, and in some cases, spot a substantial Tishan’La’Ni presence alongside the relatively uneffected wildlife.
	<br>
	- [[Huafa'vala]]: What dreadful event tore Huael’la asunder didn’t stop with the Wanderer itself, as it was in fact a curious pair of twins, verdant and wild in their abundance of life, they once flourished under the callous gaze of their cold, blue, sun. Sadly, few Wanderers are left untouched by gnashing jaws and monstrous claws, as did befall this once utopian paradise.What little remains are naught but a belt of islands, lonely and dead, with the last examples of this worlds ecosystem now nothing more than bones and dead flora.

## Ilar'sah
&emsp;The final Sphere of the trio that make up the Empire proper, is often said to be the most welcoming of the three, as it’s neither the icy blue gaze of the second, nor the fiery, raging sight of the first, but rather a gentle orange like that of firelight, a heath to return to after a long days work. Perhaps due to this natural affinity, the denizens of this Sphere are more pleasant than their fellows, or at least, they were before [[The Schism‌]] occurred, during the prior epoch.

&emsp;Since then, this Sphere is part of the Empire in claim only, due to a second curious property of its denizens; a desire for self-rule beyond the bounds of the Empire, with the capacity to form its own governance, its own rules, and its own sovereign borders. What records are available regarding the Wanderers and other bodies that dwell here, are largely unreliable, due to conflicting, and more recent reports.
<br>
- [[Chal'la]]:The most populated of this Sphere's Wanderers, chal’la is perhaps the most verdant of the Sphere, which in itself is an astonishing feat, due to the abundance of worlds capable of sustaining life, if not allowing it to prosper without seeming end. In some circles, this Wanderer was considered to be an experiment of a sort, a world without any direct governance, left to its own devices to develop and shape its own fate. This in turn allowed some very singular circumstances to occur, up to and including a nearly-successful attempt on the [Lord Imperatorius](../../Titles%20&%20Ranks/Lord%20Imperatorius.md) life.
	<br>
	- [[Shol'vaso]]: While under decree to not interfere with the development of the world below, the [[Directorate Of Studies‌]] petitioned the Lord Imperatorius to allow for the creation of a platform from which to conduct observational studies in relation to the development of independent species. Thusly, what once was a moon like any other became something wholly unique, and hollow, so as to not draw suspicions once the myriad primitives below devise a more accurate way to peer into the endless sea above.
