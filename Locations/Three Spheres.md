<small>Alternative Names: </small>
<small>Type: Star Cluster</small>

## Introduction

<small>Ruling Body: [[Tishan'La (Empire)|The Solar Empire of Tishan'La]]</small>
<small>Contested Claims:</small>

&emsp;The Three Spheres, as they are commonly referred to, are a trio of suns that are within a close enough proximity of each other to allow for the connection of a series of [[Pathways]] as a method of near-instantaneous transportation. Of course, this isn't the only method, as there are the countless courier [[Gliders]] and unmanned [[Pathfinder]] vessels that move between the Three Spheres in pre-determined routes. The routes between each Sphere have no official name, besides commonly the commonly accepted term of [[Road]].

&emsp;While the domain of Tishan'La does in fact extend beyond the Three Spheres into smaller, less populated regions, commonly referred to as the [[Far Realms]]. These realms are as small as one might expect, with some being little more than an outpost housing a half-dozen.

&emsp;As is so frequently the case with interstellar bodies, the three are often used as focal points of reverence and worship from many [[Solar Cults]], as well as the three most prominent faiths that exist within the empire, those being; [[The Followers of Shalei'Kah]], [[The Sunstained Church]], and [[The Disciples]].

&emsp;The Three Sphere consist of a trio of solar systems, each of which house a number of planets, moons, notable celestial phenomena, and smaller, artificial constructs. Collectively, the Three Spheres contains an overwhelming majority of the population of [[Tishan'La (Empire)|Tishan'La]], though some hold a higher population than others, and thusly are regularly overlooked, in certain circles of society. Each Sphere, and the significant celestial bodies that orbit them, are listed here.

## Nalre'sah
&emsp;Nalre'sah is a great, red star with a baleful gaze, and is often referred to as the most boastful of the three, with its respective faith [[The Disciples]] having a tendency to be overly proud, sometimes to the point of shunning those denizens of the other Spheres, let alone outsiders from the Far Realms and beyond. Due to the fact that the [[Throneworld]] orbits this Sphere in particular, it has both a higher total population, and higher rate of immigration than its fellow Spheres of the Empire.
