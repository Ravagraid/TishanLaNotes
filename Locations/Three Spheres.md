## Introduction

<small>Ruling Body: [[Tishan'La (Empire)|The Solar Empire of Tishan'La]]</small>
<small>Contested Claims:</small>

The Three Spheres, as they are commonly referred to, are a trio of suns that are within a close enough proximity of each other to allow for the connection of a series of [[Pathways]] as a method of near-instantaneous transportation. Of course, this isn't the only method, as there are the countless courier [[Gliders]] and unmanned [[Pathfinder]] vessels that move between the Three Spheres in pre-determined routes. The routes between each Sphere have no official name, besides commonly the commonly accepted term of [[Road]].
