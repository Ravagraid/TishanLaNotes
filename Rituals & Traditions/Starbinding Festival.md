# Starbinding Festival
<small>Pronunciation: as read out.</small>

## Introduction
&emsp;The Empire, by its nature as a political entity that spans not merely one Wanderer, but a multitude of celestial bodies, plays host to a vast multitude of celebrations and practices that to outsiders, might seem either entirely pointless, or wholly ridiculous. Thus, do we discuss what is perhaps the most singular of events, wrought from the mind of the Lord Imperatorius himself and made into a rather secretive, but still celebratory occasion.

&emsp;Within the hallowed halls of the [Thronespire](../Locations/Terrestrial/Thronespire.md), past guarded doors and warded paths exists the Lords most sacred of havens, devised as a respite from the rest of his domain, where no other might enter, without prior permission. Some have taken to calling it the Royal Menagerie, while others would call it a den of beasts, for that is a much more accurate term. Regardless of the label, it is within this inner haven that a ritual is observed on an annual basis, wholly unique to the denizens of his most decadent domain.

&emsp;The celebration is of the “birth” of the Lord himself, who from the seemingly endless strife of disparate peoples, forged an Empire and bound those countless squabbling fiefdoms beneath its ever expanding influence. It is a day of celebration, of reverence and of worship, focused on the one being that succeeded where so many others had failed. It is also a day that only a select few, those being his personal collection of beasts, may celebrate, as such.. Public displays of authority would go against the notion that Tishan’La is united under a set of ideas, rather than under a single person.

### History
&emsp;As one might have determined, the origins of this most exclusive of celebrations began between the claiming of the second, and third Spheres, specifically upon the establishment of the first permanent settlement within the influence of Jhae’Sah itself. This, by its nature as a singular occasion, gave rise to a celebration where Tishan’La was named a Solar Empire, or Extra-Solar, if one were to be pedantic about naming conventions, by the current Lord Imperatorius. The event itself was named [Foundersday](Foundersday.md), and it is still celebrated as a day to commemorate the crossing of the threshold, from older and more barbaric times, to a societal advancement beyond petty squabbles and ceaseless conflict. As irony would have it, this very day would open the door to yet further troubles, closer to home.

&emsp;Upon the return of the Royal Precession, and the accompanied departure of the nobility in attendance, it is said that while the Lord held council with his Keepers, no doubt on the subject of a matter most urgent, as he so often did. During one such meeting, it would be a beast of all in attendance, that would broach the idea of the Festival. The name of this beast is unknown, and what records remain of that fateful evening record her as being of a meek disposition, with a mind that saw what could not be seen.

&emsp;This unnamed creature spoke up only when she was alone with the Lord, as was expected of so demure a beast, to confide in him an idea she had upon watching from his side, the celebration of the first, true colony that expanded his domain. She spoke of a more personal moment to reflect upon the expansion of his realm, a moment shared only with those who he found most appreciative of all that he had built, and all that he had done to ensure a relatively safe reign; with his Royal Menagerie.

&emsp;That very same day he would gather his beasts, those few that made up the still-nascent and declare two to be the representations of the two Spheres themselves, as exemplars of particular traits that he found to be most desirable. Some of a more sceptical variety might consider such an act to be boastful beyond measure, and it is known that some among those beasts that weren’t chosen for the most prestigious of temporary roles harboured some mild envy, for their sisters.

&emsp;On that day, per annum, the ceremony would repeat as a festival of revelry and joy, of pride and passion as his beasts were given leave to enjoy themselves in ways rarely allowed, let alone handed out by his most merciful hand. In time, those that held the positions at their conception would depart for the [Endless Sea](../Locations/Stellar/Endless%20Sea.md), and another pair would take their place as envoys of the Spheres themselves, to pledge their devotion to the Lord who reached for the heavens and took for himself what no others had. This, as one can surmise, was merely the beginning, as soon enough there would be a third role to claim.

### Execution
Is there a formulaic system of the execution of the tradition or ritual? What do they signify?

### Components And Tools
Physical items used for the rituals of this custom. This can be religious items, icons, narcotics, spices, foodstuff, or simple a tall pole with colourful ribbons extending from its top.

### Participants & Key Roles
&emsp;Perhaps the most important roles that are taken up during this ritual, are the roles of the Three Sisters, or [Three Spheres](../Locations/Stellar/Three%20Spheres.md). These roles are given to three of the Lords beasts who best exemplify the attributes of each of the three, and are thus obliged to perform for onlookers, whether through acts of dance, service, or outright worship of the Lord Imperatorius himself, for all to see. As with all matters ceremonial, the acts performed by the three themselves hold a special significance, to represent that on the day the Lord appeared, even the stars themselves would bow to his will.

#### Nalre'Sah
&emsp;First then, would be the guiding light of the Throneworld, Nalre’sah, or as have taken to calling her, Nala. She’s often described in religious writings as being proud of her influence, and of her many sons and daughters that call the Throneworld home, she is often the eldest of the three, and is thus motherly in a stern, but still kind way, like many more strict parents tend to be.

&emsp;Hers is the colour of fire and fury, of passion for ones own, and for what has been built; a deep, crimson red, the colour of the eye that burns during the day with lavish trinkets that display the wealth of the lands she represents. Thusly, she is often depicted as being adorned in shining gold and exquisive gemstones, to reflect the many wanderers that dwell within her starlit domain.

&emsp;During proceedings, Nala is often the one called upon first, the most outspoken when it comes to answering queries, silencing the bickering of other beasts and above all else, singing the sweet songs of reverence that her Lord so enjoys to hear. This, of course, results in requiring a sterner approach than her siblings, but as texts would have it, she seems to relish in the authoritative grasp.

#### Jhae'Sah
&emsp;While it is the norm that one lists siblings in order of age, the Lord took to listing them in order of conquest instead, whilst nascent religious orders took to providing Janae with the appearance of the youngest sibling, that of a quiet, shy creature that holds in her heart an affection unparalleled. In early religious texts, she has been known to display bouts of playful, trickster-esque behaviour, designed to beguile and befuddle those that would seek mastery of her.

&emsp;There would be no more perfect a depiction of the youngest sphere, than that held in [The Disciples](../Organisations/Religious/The%20Disciples.md) position, a fresco of sublime simplicity, which drew upon geometric shapes as a backdrop to the figure herself. In such a work, she is adorned in a muted blue and silver, both to represent the sphere itself, as well as to provide a distinct contrast to her warmer, brighter sisters.

&emsp;During the festival itself, she can be demure, but can also be affectionate in wordless ways, such as clinging to the leg of her Lord, or leaning into even the slightest touch he might deign to give her. Of course, she would do so without hogging every affection that is handed out, but rather only what is directed at her, specifically.

#### Ilar'Sah
&emsp;Between the passionate pride of the eldest, and the demure, gentle nature of the youngest dwells the purview of the middle child, one possessed of a warmth unlike that of the prior two, whose very presence could be likened to that of a gentle, crackling fire after a days work.

&emsp;As one might expect of a star with an orange-yellow hue, the colour of her silks are much the same, bright, but not garish, warm but not overwhelming, much like her gentle features and soothing smile. In part due to the glow about her, Liarna (Lee-ar-na) carries little if any adornments, and certainly not anything as proud as gold, nor as cold as silver, but rather she is often seen with a pair of anklets, fashioned from a chain of bells that chime with every step.

&emsp;This role, unlike the two before it, wasn’t introduced like the others were, in that the roles of Janae and Nala had existed since the very beginning. In fact, it was only once the Sphere was brought into the Empire proper, as an established and core territory, rather than that of a mere outpost or one of the many Far Realms. In fact, there has even been some speculation amongst Pioneers, that the most contemporary interpretations of this very Sphere were formed from the likeness of one particular beast that belonged to the Lord Imperatorius himself, though such notions are mere conjecture at best, and conspiracy theories at worst.

&emsp;Curiously, the role of Liarna itself has become somewhat more scorned than celebrated by fellow beasts, due to the relatively recent attempt on the Lord Imperatorius’ life, and subsequent declaration of independence for the Sphere as a whole. Though this too plays into the very role of Liarna, as a byword for those beasts that fight against the order of things, to the point of being obstinate. Even so, this role hasn’t been disavowed by His Grace, nor has it been removed, perhaps as a symbol that even the wayward shall one day return to the fold, whether willing or not.

### Observance
When are the rites observed? Do the rituals take place on a set date or based on a lunar or otherwise calendar/calculation system?
